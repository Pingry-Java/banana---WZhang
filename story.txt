Sringeri Srinavas had nobody to whom to sell his bananas.  In an effort to get rid of his bananas, 
Sringeri talked to all the townspeople, but nobody would buy them.  In the end, the only one who 
would eat his bananas was himself.  He ate bananas, all day and his friends and family 
grimaced at the very sight of him.  It seemed as if all he cared about was his bananas.  
He became numb in every aspect; his family left but he turned away, callously consuming bananas.
He was no longer the fresh youth who had a life of hope, but an elderly man whose life was bananas.  
In the end, he died a sad, lonely death; his funeral consisted of a full attendance of bananas.
He lay on his deathbed surrounded by the cruel fruit of deception.
